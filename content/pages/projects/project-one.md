  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably
  because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead
  most of the time.

Essay on Image, Memory, and Symbol

This image began as a photograph — taken in 1965, in Eritrea, of a boy from the Beni Amer tribe. It appeared in National Geographic, and from there, it quietly entered the walls and memories of thousands: in Ethiopia, in diaspora homes, in guesthouses and hotel lobbies. For decades, the
boy’s image was everywhere. And yet — no one knew his name or his story. That contradiction struck me. The boy was familiar, but unknown. Loved, but never questioned. He became a kind of silent icon --- not remembered for who he was, but for what we needed him to be. In an age where images outlive names, where myth eclipses memory, I offer not biography - but symbol. The boy is no longer who he was. He is who we need him to be: joy, resilience, forgotten history, and A flicker of hope. I remember seeing this boy’s face as a child, I was struck by the bizarreness of his figure, like RAS DASHIN peaks shrouded in morning fog, where the air itself seems thick with forgotten tales, and the landscape hums with a quiet,  unsettling power, but he stayed with me Years later, I’ve come to see him as a silent promise: a symbol of youth, dignity, and the strange power of presence. This work isn’t about explaining him — it’s about honoring what he gave me, and what he gave so many without a word. The choosing of
portraying in Cultural Iconography (post pop-art) as I call it is not for its style alone, but for its history — built on repetition, appropriation, and
icon-making. That had already happened to this boy — but without context, by reworking his image, I reclaim that language. The bold colors aren’t decoration — they’re a call to look again. To see what we’ve always carried. This isn’t nostalgia, or biography. The image was never treated as memory — it was copied, commodified, and forgotten. so I interrupt that silence. Not to celebrate, but to wake it up. To say: look again. He was everywhere. Now let him mean something.
