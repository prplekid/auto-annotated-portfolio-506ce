  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably
  because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead
  most of the time.

An prose on Image, Memory, and Symbol

This image began as
a photograph — taken in 1965, in Eritrea, of a boy from the Beni Amer tribe. It appeared in National Geographic, and from there, it quietly entered the walls and memories of thousands: in Ethiopia, in diaspora homes, in guesthouses and hotel lobbies. For decades, the boy’s image was everywhere. And yet — no one knew his name. That contradiction struck me. The boy was familiar, but unknown. Loved, but never questioned. He became a kind of silent icon — not remembered for who he was, but for what we needed him to be. In an age where images outlive names, where myth eclipses memory, I offer not biography - but symbol. The boy is no longer who he was. He is who we need him to be: joy, resilience, forgotten history, and A flicker of hope. I remember seeing this boy’s face as a child — the bruises on his cheeks, the way his hair curled, that beautiful smile. I didn’t know why, but he stayed with me — like he carried a mountain of hope. Years later, I’ve come to see him as a silent promise: a symbol of youth, dignity, and the strange power of presence. This work isn’t about explaining him — it’s about honoring what he gave me, and what he gave so many without a word. I turned to pop art not for its style alone, but for its history — built on repetition, appropriation, and icon-making. That had already happened to this boy — but without context, without care. By reworking his image, I reclaim that language. The bold colors aren’t decoration — they’re a call to look again. To see what we’ve always carried. This isn’t nostalgia, or biography. The image was never treated as memory — it was flattened, circulated, emptied. So, I interrupt that silence. Not to celebrate, but to wake it up. To say: look again. He was everywhere. Now let him mean something.
